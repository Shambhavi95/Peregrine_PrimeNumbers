# Peregrine_PrimeNumbers
Generator of Prime Numbers

This project repository contains implementation of project "Generator of Prime Numbers" using algorithms Sieve of Eratosthenes (for normal code) and Trial Division method (for Parallel code) in C++.

The project has been implemented using CMake. 

Follow the below mentioned steps to run the project –

    1.	Generating Prime Numbers using Sieve of Eratosthenes - 
        (Complete path - Peregrine_PrimeNumbers > PrimeNumbers_SOE > primes_SOE > main.cpp)

        Implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes in C++. 
          a.	Download the file and provide appropriate project path to the .cpp file in Ubuntu Linux. 
          b.	Type in the following commands – 
              make
              ./primes_SOE

    2.	Generating Prime Numbers using multhreading –
        (Complete path - Peregrine_PrimeNumbers > PrimeNumbers_Multithreading > primes_mul > main.cpp)

        Implementation of Trial Division method with multithreading in C++. 
          a.	Download the file and provide appropriate project path to the .cpp file in Ubuntu Linux.
          b.	Type in the following commands – 
              make
              ./primes_mul
